  <p>
    You've come to the right place! At least if blogs, articles, fun little coding projects and so forth are things that spark your particular interest.
    Most of the stuff you'll find here will be fun little quirky projects, algorithm and datastructure implementations, some dabblings in AI using deep neural nets,
    convolutional and recurrent neural nets, genetic algorithms, guides regarding fun stuff I encountered in .NET or any other framework, and much more.
  </p>
  <p>
    These will mainly be in Rust, C# and some Python here and there, or other languages, depending on what suits me at that time. 
    Also, expect some explanation on a Sudoku solver (in fact, you can check that out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L5uJniKtyA" target="_blank">here</a>),
    game AI agents, fun projects with computer vision, and whatever else that I think is worth sharing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes I'll go deep into implementation details, other times it'll be more high level. In any case: it'll be fun to explore,
    and hopefully it'll set off a spark in you! I will explain the reasoning behind what I do, and also share code, either
    using code snippets, links to my GitHub repos or Jupyter notebooks you can just download.
